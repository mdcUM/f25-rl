As Cyrus approaches the fountain in the bustling market square, he notices a shimmering, ancient artifact hidden beneath a pile of leaves. He carefully lifts the leaves, revealing a glowing crystal that reflects the sunlight with an enchanting brilliance. With a sense of wonder, Cyrus reaches out to pick it up, but his fingers brush the edge of a hidden hole, triggering a mechanism that releases a stream of water at him. The water, misting in the warm air, forms a shimmering curtain around the fountain, revealing a hidden passage within its depths. Cyrus hesitates for a moment, torn between the allure of the shimmering crystal and the potential danger of venturing into the unknown, before he decides to rest his weary body and enjoy the mystery of the fountain for a while.

The sunlight shimmers off the cool stone fountain, its water flowing with a gentle murmur. Cyrus steps closer, its belly growling in anticipation. With a hesitant hand, it reaches out to inspect the shimmering surface, its intricate patterns barely visible in the midday heat. A small reward, a glistening apple, dances in its grasp as it rotates slightly in the water's embrace.
