IMPROVEMENTS / TODO:

================= EASY ===================

- The NPC state should be reported at the end of each day, rather than us seeing the result after the 10 days complete.

- Prompt issues:
    - LLM makes up player stats (like +10 expereince when experience doesn't exist)
    - Maybe give the LLM the previous journal entry for context (e.g. maybe dont get drunk twice in a row, or do if mood is terrible)
    - Journal Entries don't correspond with each other yet (e.g. mismatching dates "Year of Golden anvil" vs "1360")
    - Add overall Description of the 10 days after the simulation.
    - Add explanation (for us) to see the reasoning of why the LLM makes each decision between the 3 actions.

- World state changes (e.g. famine increases chances of attacks and decreases money earned)


================= HARD ===================

- Add the RL element (NPC isn't actually learning yet, LLM just makes decisions between 3 actions based on context)

- Allow player to influence the NPC

- Determine what way the hardcoded character traits influence their actions (Aldric is curious, what does that really mean in terms of his decision to do one of the actions)

- Multiple NPCs (that interact with each other?)
